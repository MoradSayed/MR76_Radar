# Assets Directory

This folder stores images and other media used by the main project documentation.

## Purpose

- Keep all README-linked assets in one place.
- Make documentation easier to maintain and review.
- Avoid broken links in the main `ReadMe.md` file.

## Usage Notes

- Put screenshots, diagrams, and GIFs here.
- Use clear file names (for example: `setup-wiring.png`, `radar-output.gif`).
- Link assets from the main README using relative paths such as `assets/your-file-name.png`.
